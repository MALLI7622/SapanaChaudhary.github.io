What is academic research all about? This is a question that I keep asking myself, frequently so. 
From whatever research experience I have, I have come to realise that there are three major components that determine the quality of research one gets to do (or atleast the one I get to do): working, networking and not-working. Working: Because if you are a researcher, you have got to do research. Networking: Because you need collaborators, mentors and reveiwers to do good research. Not-working: Because you are a human, and you need rest no matter how much you think you don't. 

All of us possess different working styles. A particular working style might suit some, and turn out to be completely ridiculous for others. What I present in this blog post is from my personal experience of being a researcher. Within each of the major components that I mention above, I list and shortly describe the sub-components that fall under them. The whole post is intentionally designed to be modular to (hopefully) get the message straight.   

Working 
------
As a researcher, a big chunk of your time is going to be naturally invested in working on your research problem(s). Working comprises of: Planning, reading, thinking, writing, researching and talking. 

- Planning 
  
  Plan your days, your weeks, your months and your years. Set long and short term goals and work towards meeting them. Be specific and detailed when it comes to setting goals. Assess your goals frequently. You should appropriately allocate time for each of the components (and sub-components) mentioned in this post. Pour your tasks out in a daily diary (online or offline). Once you have everything out, you would be easily able to navigate through tasks. Then you can assign times on your calender for each of the tasks. 
  
- Reading 
  
  Read, read a lot. Read things that are related to your work, read things that aren't. Spend at least 45 min everyday to read non-work related stuff, like a blog or a book or a paper from a perpendicular field. Try to draw connections to your work. Reading opens your mind to new ideas for your research. I spend my time reading things on Twitter
  
- Thinking
  
  I believe to be able to just sit and think is a luxury. And if you can afford to do it, do it. Thinking is a virtue. Spend a good one hour or more to think about your work related ideas. Spend at least 30 mins thinking about ideas, abstract or otherwise, related to your work or not. Just think. Thinking can be done anywhere and costs nothing. Thinking helps you in planning, choosing what to read and write next, and whom to go talk to next. Thinking is the backbone of the whole research process. 
  
- Writing 
  
  Write down your thoughts, ideas, experiments, anything and everything. You need to write to plan. You need to write to communicate your ideas. The more you do it, the better you would become at it. You don't have to allocate time to writing on a daily basis, however, make it a point to write often. 
  
- Researching: coding, writing math, ideating, logging 
  

- Talking 


Networking 
------

As a researcher, it is extremely important to think independently, and to generate ideas without biases. But, what is also important is to share your ideas. Sharing your ideas and products can be of tremendous help to you, and others.
