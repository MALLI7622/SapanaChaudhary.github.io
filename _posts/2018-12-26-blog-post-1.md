What is academic research all about? This is a question that I keep asking myself, frequently so. 
From whatever research experience I have, I have come to realise that the following three components determine the quality of research one gets to do (or atleast the quality of research I get to do): working, networking and not-working. Working: Because if you are a researcher, you have got to do research. Networking: Because you need collaborators, mentors and reveiwers to do good research. Not-working: Because you are a human, and if you need rest no matter how much you think you don't. 

All of us possess different working styles. A particular working style might suit some, and turn out to be completely ridiculous for others. What I present in this blog post is from my personal experience of being a researcher.
