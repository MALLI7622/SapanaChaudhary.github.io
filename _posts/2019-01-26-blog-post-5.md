You might have come across Pinfy in my previous blog post on [Loss function and objective function are different, or are they?](https://sapanachaudhary.github.io/colab_pages_1/) Here is the story about how she came into being. Here is a picture of her, that was created by my friend [Akshat](http://ad74.blogs.rice.edu) and me.

Pinfy was named so by her parents. Mostly because they both love Pi and Infinity, the mathematical entities. Also because Pinfy just sounds so cute. Pinfy likes teaching, especially reinforcement learning at the nearby school of fishes (pun intended; a group of fish is termed as school). She likes adorning [saris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari), a traditional Indian attire. She posses a huge collection of saris, from almost all the Indian states. From the look of spectacles, you might think she is sassy. That is just the opposite of what she is. 


The major reasons behind creation of Pinfy were my affinity towards saris, fishes, maths and teaching.
