Previosly, I had completed MS(Research) in Computational Science at IIT Madras, Chennai, India. As an interdisciplinary student, I belonged to the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I was advised by [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/). My MS thesis was titled 'On Learning Smooth Policies in Imitation Learning'.
