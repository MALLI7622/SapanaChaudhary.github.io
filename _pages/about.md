I'm a first year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, TX, USA.  I work on theory and application of Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning.

<!--- In the long run, I want to focus on using principles from the human cognition and psychology to build better reinforcement learning agents.--->    

Previously, I was a research fellow in the [Machine Teaching Group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. I was dvised by [Dr. Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html).

I have completed MS (Research) in Computational Science from IIT Madras, India. There, I was advised by [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/). My MS thesis is titled 'On Learning Smooth Policies in Imitation Learning'.
